# Azure CLI Copilot

> **WARNING:** *This extension is experimental and should not be used in a production environment. It is intended solely to demonstrate the capability of extending a CLI tool using OpenAI.*

This project is an extension for the Azure CLI that allows you to use plain English commands to run Azure CLI commands. It uses Azure OpenAI to determine the most likely Azure CLI command to run based on the plain English command you provide.

The Azure CLI documentation is used to create embeddings for each Azure CLI command. These embeddings are then stored in Azure Cognitive Search and used for [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview) to determine the most up to date syntax for the command you wish to execute.

This project is built using Microsoft Semantic Kernel SDK, which allows for easy integration with a range of services. For more information on the open source project, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)

## Usage

To use the Copilot simply use the command `az copilot --prompt "your command prompt here"`. This will invoke the call to determine the most likely Azure CLI command to run based on the prompt you provide.

The Azure CLI command will then be presented to you and you can choose to run it or not. If `autorun` is not enabled, you will need to confirm execution by pressing `y` or `return`.

If the Copilot deteremines that more information is required, such as missing parameters, it will prompt you for the additional information. At any time you can drop out of the converation by typing `quit` or `q`.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation

By default when first installed Retrieval Augmented Generation is disabled. This is to ensure the relevant Azure Cognitive Search service has been setup and populated first.

Without RAG, the Copilot will only use the Azure OpenAI model to determine the most likely Azure CLI command to run based on the prompt you provide. With the documentation embeddings, the Copilot will be able to better determine the most up to date syntax for the command you wish to execute.

Once the embeddings have been generated it is recommended to enable the use of RAG. To enable RAG, use the command `az copilot config set --use-rag true`.

### Command Flow Options

The Copilot extension has several configuration options that can be used to control the flow of the command. These are:

- `--autorun` - Automatically run the command when ready
- `--show-command` - Show the Azure CLI command to be run
- `--enable-logging` - Enable logging of the command flow

These are all boolean settings that can be set using the command `az copilot config set`.

Default settings are:
- `--autorun = false`
- `--show-command = true`
- `--enable-logging = false`.

If you are comfortable with the Copilot extension and want to speed up the flow, you can set the `--autorun` option to `true`. This will automatically run the command when ready.

> **Note:** *Any command that requires a confirmation will also be automatically confirmed. This is to ensure the command flow is not interrupted, but can be dangerous if you are not sure what the command will do, or if it is destructive.*

## Prerequisites

To use the Copilot extension you will need the following:
- An Azure subscription
- The Azure CLI installed
- Python 3.9 or later installed

## Deployment Steps

To get up and running with the Copilot extension, you will need to complete several steps. In order these are:

- Deploy required Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Services resources
- Install the Azure CLI Copilot extension
- Set the configuration values as output by the infrastructure deployment
- Run the extraction script to create up to date embeddings from the Azure CLI documentation

## Resource Deployment

To deploy the required Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Services resources, you can use the deployment script in the `infrastructure` directory. To make it simpler, a `makefile` has been provided to run the deployment script. From a `bash` terminal, run the following command:

```bash
make deploy-infra
```

When the deployment is complete, the output will be displayed in the terminal. This will include the API keys and endpoints for the Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Search resources. These values will be required when setting the configuration for the Copilot extension.

By default resources created are named `az-copilot-<unique id>`. This unique is generated by a hash of the subscription ID and current timestamp. If you wish to change this, it can be done by editing the `deploy.sh` file.

Likewise the location for deployment is set in the `deploy.sh` file. By default this is set to `uksouth`. If you wish to change this, it can be done by editing the `deploy.sh` file.

The Azure OpenAI service will also deploy two models. The first is the completion model, which is `gpt-35-turbo-16k` and the second is the embedding model, which is `text-embedding-ada-002`.

When deploying Azure OpenAI services, ensure you have enough quota available in the specified region for your subscription, or the deployment will fail.

## Extension Installation

The Copilot extension is available as a Python wheel file and can be installed using the `az extension add` command directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/irarainey/az-copilot/releases)

To install the extension, check out the releases page, determine the version number of the latest release and run the following command specifying the version number in the filename:

```bash
az extension add --source az extension add --source https://github.com/irarainey/az-copilot/releases/download/latest/copilot-0.1.15-py3-none-any.whl --yes
```

You can check the version of the extension you have installed by running the following command:

```bash
az extension list --query "[?name == 'copilot'].version" -o tsv
```

To unstall the extension, simply run the remove command:

```bash
az extension remove --name copilot
```

## Extension Configuration

The Copilot extension requires several configuration options to be set. All configuration options are stored in a local configuration file stored in the root of your user profile directory, in a directory named `.az-copilot`. The configuration file is named `config.json`.

If the configuration file does not exist, it will be created when you run the `az copilot config set` command.

You can edit this file manually, or use the `az copilot config set` command to set the configuration options. All parameters are optional. You can set a single value, or all values at once.

For information on the options available, run the command `az copilot config set --help`

This will display the following table of options:

```text
Command
    az copilot config set

Arguments
    --autorun -a                     : Boolean value to autorun the command when ready.
    --completion-name -cn            : The Azure OpenAI completion model deployment name.
    --embedding-name -en             : The Azure OpenAI embedding model deployment name.
    --enable-logging -l              : Boolean value to enable or disable logging.
    --openai-api-key -ok             : The Azure OpenAI API key.
    --openai-endpoint -oe            : The Azure OpenAI endpoint.
    --search-api-key -sk             : The Azure Cognitive Search API key.
    --search-endpoint -se            : The Azure Cognitive Search endpoint.
    --search-index-name -si          : The Azure Cognitive Search index name.
    --search-relevance-threshold -st : The Azure Cognitive Search relevance threshold.
    --search-result-count -sc        : The Azure Cognitive Search result count.
    --search-vector-size -sv         : The Azure Cognitive Search vector size.
    --show-command -s                : Boolean value to show or hide commands.
    --use-rag -r                     : Boolean value to enable or disable RAG.
```

Additionally you can use the command `az copilot config show` to display the current configuration options.

> **NOTE:** For security API keys are not displayed in the output.

## Generate Embeddings

Once the Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Services resources have been deployed, the Copilot extension has been installed, and the configuration values have been set, you can generate the embeddings required for RAG.

To generate the embeddings, you can use the `main.py` script in the `extract` directory. To make it simpler, a `makefile` has been provided to run the extraction script. From a `bash` terminal, run the following command:

```bash
make extract-docs
```

This script will extract the latest version of the Azure CLI documentation directly from the GitHub repository in YAML format, parse it, and create the embeddings required for RAG. A single text document is created locally in the `extract/docs` directory for each command, which includes syntax and examples, and is then used to create the embeddings which are stored in Azure Cognitive Search.

At the time of writing there are just over 11,000 Azure CLI commands. Depending upon the speed of your connection, this process will take around one hour to complete. The script will output the progress to the terminal.
